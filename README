You can see the web application up and running in the following URL: http://ernestoreigcv.appspot.com.
It is, of course, a very small project, but it can be regarded as a base project structure in order to
develop a large project. I mean, this project could have been made with very low complexity without
following any design pattern. For example I could have used a small set of php's or html's with a bit of javascript.

It does not make any asynchronous call to the server in order to get data, because the
complexity is very low and the data that is displayed is static, that is, the data is not retrieved
from any database in the server and then sent to the client. The data is statically written in the
code.
But the thing is that it is ready to be put together with the other layers (or modules) that a
large project could be composed of, keeping them separated with no dependence. It could be
regarded as the presentation layer or client module of a large project, and connecting it to the
server side would be done in a very easy and clean way.

The project honours the Model View Presenter design pattern using the MVP built-in
framework that comes with GWT. The MVP pattern decouples development in a way that
allows multiple developers to work simultaneously in a project. For example, a team could be
working in the server module of the project without affecting the client side and vice versa.
Moreover, the MVP pattern allows you to implement different views depending on different
properties. For example the user agent, like a normal desktop web browser or a mobile web
browser, a view or another will be presented to the user depending on where he/she is
accessing from. Therefore, different developers could work on different implementations of a
given view without changing a single line of code of the rest of the application.
